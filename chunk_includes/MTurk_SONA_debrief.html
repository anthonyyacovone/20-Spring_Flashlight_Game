<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong><u>What is this study about?</u></strong></h2>
<p>This study is testing a new method for studying reading called mouse-tracking. In the lab, we typically monitor people's eyes as they read sentences. People do not simply scan the page, reading sentences word-by-word. Rather, 
  they jump all over the page, going back to re-read certain things, skipping over short or predictable words, spending more time on difficult or unexpected words, etc. We are hoping to develop a mouse-tracking paradigm that can
  capture the richness of eye-tracking data using an online platform.</p>

<hr>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong><u>How did we do this?</u></strong></h2>
<p>We essentially took the greatest "hits" from the eye-tracking literature and tried to replicate the original findings (but using mouse-tracking instead). You saw a series of sentences: some that were completely normal,
  some that were a bit unusual, and some that were entirely impossible. Consider the three sentences below:</p>
  
<li>John used a knife to chop <b>the large carrots</b> for dinner last night. (normal sentence)</li>
<li>John used an axe to chop <b>the large carrots</b> for dinner last night. (unusual sentence)</li>
<li>John used a pump to inflate <b>the large carrots</b> for dinner last night. (impossible sentence)</li>

<p><b>We were interested in a few things given these three types of sentences:</b> <br>
  &nbsp;<i>1) Did you "look" longest at "the large carrots" in the impossible sentence relative to the others?<br></i>
  &nbsp;<i>2) Did you go back and re-read any earlier parts of the sentence in the unusual/impossible sentences?<br></i>
  &nbsp;<i>3) Did you take longer to re-read the earlier parts in the impossible relative to the unusual sentence?</i><p>
  
<hr>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong><u>Why should we do this study?</u></strong></h2>
<p> We hope this task will be the first steps toward creating an online, child-friendly way to track children's reading development. This "reading-in-the-dark" paradigm will hopefully provide similar data to the traditional 
  eye-tracking studies completed in the lab. We thank you for your participation and hope you will provide feedback about the task (did you have fun? do you think children can do it?).</p>
